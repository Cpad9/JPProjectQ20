## Project Prompt
OraclProduction Ltd are specialists in producing production 
line manufacturing plants. They could be asked to create a 
production plant for any type of product ranging from a simple
packaging system to a variety of electronic devices. Recently
they have been asked to create a production line for multimedia
devices which include music and movie players. They wish to 
employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording
all future production line items. For this particular production
facility you will only implement a concrete class for music 
and movie players. Your task is to create a flexible structure
that could be used in any production line. This structure would
then allow easy modification to handle different products.
